 *  **Classic Donation**.- The classic paypal  When The user clicks the button he will be directed to the paypal page and he will define how much he want to donate there.
 
 *  **TextBox Donation**.- A paypal button with a text box so the donors can pick right away how much they want to donate.
   
 * **Three Buttons Donation**.- Three donation buttons (they dont have to be paypal buttons, you can customize them) each one with a different amounts (that you define) so the donators can donate with one click. (Paypal)
    
 *  **Slider Donation**.- This has an slider that the user can scroll to donate more or less money (you define the minimun and maximun amount), it also has a happy face that gets happier or not that happy depending on the donation amount. (Paypal)
 
 * **Forms**.- (Pro feature) You need to ask something to the donors? then Forms donations is the way to go, you can create a custom form the way you want it (you can add text boxes, drop downs, checkboxes etc). Once you get a donation you will get an email with all that information. (Paypal only)

PayPal also support IPN notifications so you can keep track of all the donations, you can show a donation goal meter or analize how well you have been doing in a period of time.
